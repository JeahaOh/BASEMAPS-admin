</head>
<body>
<p>BASEMAPS web application manages different geographical services provided by source URL.</p>
<p>The application is written in Java 1.8, is running on Tomcat (9.0) or any other similar servlet container server. 
Database of Postgres 9.6 is required and BASEMAPS is using Hibernate to connect to the database.</p>
<p>The main interaction and data exchange is done by http requests and responses and available methods can 
be found in controllers package ({@link fi.fta.controllers}). The application uses two kinds of beans (object wrappers):
database or model beans, and user interface beans (JSON), most of them have their alternatives in both packages and 
the fields might slightly differ. Usually they can be converted between one kind to another by constructors and 
do not need special tools. Data beans are managed by data managers ({@link fi.fta.data.managers}), where business logics is applied and also saved 
or updated to database by data access objects ({@link fi.fta.data.dao}). User interface wrappers are used for exposig data to application 
users.</p>
<p>After users provide a new data service, the application parses it from remote source and saves to the database. The application 
requires separate parse helper for each kind of service ({@link fi.fta.utils.parse}, {@link fi.fta.utils.parse.wms}, {@link fi.fta.utils.parse.wfs}), helpers use version specifications 
to get the correct data from remote service. In order to extract more data from the service, the description 
of new fields must be added to all specifications.</p>
